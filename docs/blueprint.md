# **App Name**: Legislation Tracker

## Core Features:

- Kanban Board Display: Display bill cards in a scrollable, sortable kanban board format, with columns representing different stages of the legislative process.
- Drag and Drop Functionality: Allow users to drag and drop bill cards between columns to update their status.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search function to quickly find bills by name or keyword.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral gray background to provide a clean and professional look.
- Secondary color: Light blue for column headers to differentiate them from the bill cards.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Use a horizontal layout for the kanban board, allowing users to scroll through the different stages of the legislative process.
- Incorporate simple icons to visually represent different bill statuses or actions (e.g., a calendar icon for 'Scheduled').
- Use smooth transitions when dragging and dropping bill cards between columns.
