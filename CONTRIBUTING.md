## Branching Strategy
Repository is organized with branches:
- **dev** - new features are always merged to this branch 
- **main** - production branch, requires production-level code and intensive testing. PR from dev to main

When making a new feature branch, use these naming conventions: 

- **feature/*** → Task-specific branches for new features or epics.
Example: feature/kilo-dashboard-filters

- **hotfix/*** → Urgent fixes required for production issues.
Example: hotfix/fix-login-crash

- **bugfix/*** → Notable bugs found during testing, requiring refactoring or fixes.
Example: bugfix/llm-timeout-handler

- **optimize/*** → Code optimizations, addressing security
Example: optimize/integrate-react-query

## Pull Requests (PRs)
We use GitHub to monitor version control and manage reviews. Every change should go through a Pull Request. Exceptions would be quick code changes to configure on deployment. 

### PR Workflow
1. Create a branch (addressing task/issue with proper naming conventions) off of `dev` branch
   - `git checkout dev`
   - `git checkout -b <name of branch>`
2. Push your changes to your branch.
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "<commit message for iterative change>"`
   - `git push`
3. Wait for CI checks (lint, typecheck, build, tests) to pass.
   - `npm run lint`
4. Open a PR in GitHub.
5. Fill out the PR template.
6. Request review from a cluster/project lead
7. Cluster lead will merge to main
8. Update [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with your most recent push
