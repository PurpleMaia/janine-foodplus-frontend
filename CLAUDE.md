# Food+ Bill Tracker — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Food+ is a Next.js web app for tracking food-related legislation in Hawaii. It uses a multi-tenant architecture where organizations can manage their own bill tracking, statuses, tags, and team members independently.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Kysely (query builder, not ORM)
- **Auth:** Custom session-based auth (Lucia-compatible, cookie-based)
- **Email:** Resend
- **UI:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Drag-and-drop:** @hello-pangea/dnd
- **Testing:** Vitest
- **AI:** OpenAI (`src/services/llm.ts`) for bill-status classification and version/report summaries. Prompts live in `src/lib/ai/summary-prompts.ts`. Config via `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

**Where things live (navigation rule for agents):**
- A database query? → `src/db/queries/*` (e.g. `bills-read.ts`, `bills-write.ts`, `bill-assignment.ts`, `proposals.ts`, `admin.ts`, `tags.ts`, `tenants.ts`, `access.ts`, `derived-status.ts`). Mappers (DB row → client `Bill`) are in `bill-mappers.ts`.
- A call to a third-party API (LLM/email/scraper)? → `src/services/*`.
- A client component fetching/mutating data? → it calls `data.*` from `@/lib/data-client` (NOT raw `fetch`).
- Auth/authorization in a route or action? → `@/lib/auth/auth-guards`.

### Multi-Tenancy Model

- **Tenants** are organizations. Each has members with `org_role` (admin | worker).
- **Public users** (no tenant) see food-related bills only.
- **Tenant-scoped users** see bills tracked by anyone in their org.
- Bill statuses: public `bills.bill_status` is derived from AI + org consensus. Each org stores its own status in `org_bills`.
- Tags are tenant-scoped. Bills can have different tags per tenant.
- `user_bills` tracks which user tracks which bill, with `tenant_id` for org scoping.

### Data Access — the switchable data-client (IMPORTANT)

Every data operation has TWO interchangeable implementations over the SAME `db/queries` function:
1. a **Server Action** arm (`src/app/actions/*`, `'use server'`), and
2. an **API-route fetch** arm (`src/app/api/*`).

A flag picks which one runs, invisibly to callers. This exists because Server Actions are idiomatic but were observed to perform worse, so we keep both and can flip between them.

- **Client components/hooks call `data.*`**, never raw `fetch`. e.g. `import { data } from '@/lib/data-client'; await data.bills.getBills({ viewMode, showArchived, tenantId })`. Domains (see `data-client/index.ts`): `data.bills`, `data.proposals`, `data.access`, `data.preferences`, `data.testimony`, `data.boards`, `data.summaries`, `data.legislators`, `data.committees`.
- **Transport selection** lives in `src/lib/data-client/transport.ts`: global default `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_TRANSPORT` (`'fetch'` | `'action'`, defaults to `'fetch'`) plus a per-operation `OVERRIDES` map keyed `'domain.op'`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is build-time inlined, so the global default is a per-deploy choice; `OVERRIDES` gives code-level per-op control.
- **The contract** (what makes the flag flip with zero caller edits): for every operation, the `action` and `fetch` arms take identical params and return the SAME already-unwrapped value (throw on error). The data-client is the ONE place `ActionResult<T>` and the HTTP envelope get unwrapped. `defineClient` (in `define-client.ts`) structurally requires the fetch arm's signature to match the action arm.
- **Adding an operation:** write the `db/queries` function (the source of truth), add an action wrapper in `actions/<domain>.ts`, add a fetch wrapper hitting the route in `lib/data-client/<domain>.client.ts`, and register the `{ action, fetch }` pair in that domain's `defineClient`.
- The **fetch arm uses relative URLs** → it only runs client-side (all current callers qualify).
- Not everything is flag-switched: `use-tracked-bills` / `assign-bill-dialog` call some `'use server'` query functions directly (valid server actions); the **admin** domain runs exclusively through server actions (`actions/admin.ts`).

### Auth Flow

Auth/authorization for BOTH routes and actions goes through `@/lib/auth/auth-guards`. Four guards, each with `.fromRequest(request, tenantId?)` (routes) and `.fromAction(tenantId?)` (actions):
- `requireSession` — must be logged in.
- `optionalSession` — resolves the user if present, else `{ user: null }` (no throw); for endpoints with a public branch (e.g. the bills list).
- `requireMembership` — logged in AND a member of `tenantId` (returns `orgRole`).
- `requireAdmin` — org admin when tenant-scoped, else legacy global admin.

Guards throw an `ApiError` (`@/lib/core/errors`); routes map it via `if (error?.statusCode) ...`, actions wrap it in an `ActionResult`. Underneath: `validateSession` / `auth()` (`@/lib/auth/session`), `getSessionCookie` (`@/lib/auth/cookies`), `validateMembership` (`@/db/queries/tenants`). Do NOT re-implement the cookie→session→membership preamble inline; use a guard.

Tenant service mutation functions (`addMember`, `removeMember`, etc.) also have built-in auth guards; internal callers that already validated auth pass `{ skipAuth: true }`.

### Derived Status Algorithm

`deriveBillStatus()` in `src/lib/bills/derived-status.ts` is a PURE function (no DB) that computes the public bill status:
1. AI status is the floor (official records).
2. Org consensus (mode, or median if no mode) is the ceiling.
3. If consensus >= floor, use consensus (orgs have fresher info). Otherwise use AI.
4. Deferred statuses (not shown as kanban columns) are mapped via `EXTENDED_INDEX` to their logical pipeline positions.

The DB-backed `recomputeDerivedStatus()` (reads `ai_status` + `org_bills`, writes `bills.bill_status`) lives separately in `src/db/queries/derived-status.ts`, keeping the algorithm pure and unit-testable.

### Invite Flow

1. Admin sends invite via `/api/tenants/[id]/invite` (creates `invite_tokens` row, sends email).
2. Recipient clicks link to `/register?invite=TOKEN`.
3. Registration route atomically claims the token (`UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending' RETURNING ...`), verifies the email matches, then creates user + membership.

## Key Conventions

- **Kysely for all queries** — no raw SQL. Parameterized by default (no injection risk). All queries live in `src/db/queries/*` — that is the single source of truth. Routes and actions are thin transports over them; do not put inline `db.*` queries in a route/action.
- **Tenant scoping** — all queries touching `user_bills`, `org_bills`, `tags`, `bill_tags` must filter by `tenant_id` when in a tenant context.
- **`src/lib/` is DB-free** — pure utilities, validators, constants, permission helpers, and the auth-guards/data-client wiring. Anything that runs a query belongs in `src/db/queries/`.
- **`src/lib/` is grouped by domain, imported by deep path** — `@/lib/core/utils`, `@/lib/bills/kanban-columns`, `@/lib/auth/session`. There are deliberately NO barrel `index.ts` files: import the actual module so dependencies stay visible and bundles stay tight. Note `@/lib/auth/session` holds what used to be `lib/auth.ts` (renamed so it couldn't shadow the `auth/` directory).
- **Auth via guards** — routes and actions both authorize through `@/lib/auth/auth-guards` (`requireSession`/`optionalSession`/`requireMembership`/`requireAdmin`). Don't hand-roll the cookie→session→membership preamble.
- **Client data via the data-client** — client components call `data.*` from `@/lib/data-client`, not raw `fetch`. See "Data Access" above.
- **A `'use server'` file may only export async functions** — no `export *`, no re-export statements, no type exports. Keep shared types/mappers in plain (non-`'use server'`) modules like `db/queries/bill-mappers.ts`.
- **Tests** are pure unit tests in `src/lib/__tests__/`. They test pure functions only (no DB, no mocking). Use `describe`/`it`/`expect` from vitest.

## Testing

Tests live in `src/lib/__tests__/` (flat, not mirrored) — ~38 Vitest files covering
pure logic only (no DB, no network). Highlights: `derived-status`, `kanban-columns`,
`detailed-stages`/`progress-stages`, `validators`, `permissions`, `dead-bill`,
`bill-search`/`bill-filters`, `version-diff` (+ HTML fixtures in `__tests__/fixtures/`),
`testimony-eligibility`, `glossary`, `ratelimit-memory`, `cookies`, `errors`, `utils`.

Run `pnpm test` before committing. All tests must pass. Also run `pnpm typecheck` and
`pnpm build`. **Note:** `next.config.ts` sets `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` and
`eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true`, so the build does NOT fail on type or lint errors —
run `pnpm typecheck` separately to actually catch them. The build's own value is
catching `'use server'` export violations that `tsc` does not.

## Commit Style

- Prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `bug:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
- Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By` lines to commit messages.
- Do NOT delete old API routes when creating consolidated replacements.
